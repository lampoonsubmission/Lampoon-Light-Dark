# Tech Comp F23 — Our Site

Hello and welcome to the *Harvard Lampoon*’s Fall 2023 Technical Comp. Founded in 1876, the *Harvard Lampoon* is the world’s oldest comedy magazine and the first to do a sponsorship deal with FTX.

Every year we publish 5 magazines, *n* digital parodies, and 1 communal Jane Street quant application. Our members have gone on to build great things, including *The Simpsons*, *The Office*, *SNL*, and the internet sensation *SmashOrPass.AI*. Notable alumni of the *Lampoon* include Conan O’Brien (not tech board), Colin Jost (not tech board), John Updike (not tech board), and the founder of BuyXR (tech board!). Sometimes we invite celebrities to the castle for our version of the WWDC Scholars’ Summit; these honorary members include Steve Aoki, the Strokes, Tony Hawk, the creators of Jackbox, RDJ, Elon Musk, Benjamin Bolger, and Benjamin Bolger a second time.

The *Harvard Lampoon*’s technical comp is the hardest at Harvard, but if you went through a Rubik’s Cube phase in middle school, you’ll turn out just fine. I promise.

## The First Round

In the first round, you will be improving our current website, found in this GitHub repository. We might have some predefined tasks for you, but we also expect you to come up with other improvements or ideas on your own.

The website has a Django backend with a Sqlite database for local development. Prior knowledge of Django is not important; as long as you can [RTFM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/), you’ll be fine. If you don’t like Django, just be patient — the next round is a lot more open-ended.

## Running

```sh
# Create a virtual environment.

## Office Hours

Starting Tuesday, September 19th, we will have office hours at the Lampoon Castle each week. We’ll workshop ideas, take a look at your work, and tell you whether or not you are on the right track. Regular attendance at office hours is crucial to a successful comp and to our emotional well-being.
